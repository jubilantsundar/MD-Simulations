# my_md_scripts
This repository contains my scripts to submit molecular dynamics simulations for Gromacs
All scripts assume a version of Gromacs is installed and callable using 'gmx'
For ligand-bound systems, the scripts assume the ligand.gro and ligand.itp files were prepared using other tools like acpype from AmberTools.
